# DESCRIPTION:
  # This kata is inspired by a lecture video about domain specific languages and the ruby object model available on youtube.
  # Watching the video is highly recommended but not necessary to complete the kata. You can find the link below.

  # Your task is to implement a domain specific language (the recipe class) in which one can define recipes in
  # the following manner:

  # recipe = Recipe.new('mix') do
  #   ingredient "salt"
  #   ingredient "sugar"

  #   step "mix salt & sugar"
  #   step "throw it in the bin"
  # end

  # puts recipe
  # and by defining the to_s of recipes the above program outputs:

  # mix
  # ===
  # salt, sugar

  # 0.) mix salt & sugar
  # 1.) throw it in the bin
  # The format starts with the name of the recipe passed as an argument to Recipe.new.
  # It's followed by matching number of '='s on the next line. Then the ingredients on one line, separated by commas.
  # This is followed by an empty line and then the steps in a numbered list.

class Recipe
  attr_reader :name, :ingredients, :steps

  def initialize(name, &block)
    @name = name
    @ingredients = []
    @steps = []
    instance_eval(&block) if block_given?
  end

  def ingredient(name)
    @ingredients << name
  end

  def step(description)
    @steps << description
  end

  def to_s
    output = "#{name}\n"
    output += "=" * name.length + "\n"
    output += ingredients.join(", ") + "\n\n"
    output += steps.each_with_index.map { |step, index| "#{index}.) #{step}\n" }.join()
    output
  end
