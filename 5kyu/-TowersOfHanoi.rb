# DESCRIPTION:
  # Towers of Hanoi is a game where there are 3 pegs, which we will call "A", "B" and "C".
  # Peg A starts with X number of discs, each disc is smaller than the disc underneith.

  # The game is to move all the discs from A to C, 1 at a time, without ever having a disc on top of a smaller disc.

  # You are given the number of discs initially on peg A, and you must return the shortest list of moves to get all
  # the discs to C. A move is an array of 2 items, the peg the disc is moving from and the peg it's moving too.
  # ['A', 'C'] means move from peg A to C.

  # e.g.

  # Hanoi.new(1).moves => [['A', 'C']]
  # Hanoi.new(2).moves => [['A', 'B'], ['A', 'C'], ['B', 'C']]
  # The number of discs will be 0 < n < 10

# My solution


# Best one
