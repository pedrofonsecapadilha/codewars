# DESCRIPTION:
  # You have a class called Node, representing a node in a binary tree
  # (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree).
  # Each node has 2 children - the right child and the left child. These children can of course be null.

  # You job is to add an instance method, height, which returns the longest branch steming from
  # the tree (starting from this node). For example, this tree would result in 3:

  #         (Node)
  #         /    \
  #     (Node)  (Node)
  #     /          \
  #   (Node)      (Node)
  #        \
  #       (Node)

  # Recursion is not necessary, but highly recommended.

# My solution



# Best one
