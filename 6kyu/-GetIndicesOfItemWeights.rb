# DESCRIPTION:
  # Get Indices of Item Weights

  # Given a package with a weight limit limit and an array arr of item weights, implement a
  # method (ruby)/function (javascript) that finds two items whose sum of weights equals the weight limit limit.
  # Your method/function should return a pair ex. [i, j] of the indices of the item weights.
  # If such a pair doesn’t exist, return nil/null.

  # Challenge Complete in under O(n^2) a.k.a. quadratic time complexity

  # Constraints: Returned Array elements could not be the same index position so [1, 1] would not be acceptable...

  # Return the first pair, a.k.a lexographically speaking, that sums up to the limit

  # [input] array.integer arr 2 ≤ arr.length ≤ 100

  # [input] integer limit

  # [output] array.integer

# My solution


# Best one
